# Quantum-time-travel
A simple concept of quantum time travel algorithm using Qiskit 
The provided code defines a Python function for creating a fictional quantum circuit that supposedly  "sends" qubits to a target time. It's important to remember this is a simplified representation for educational purposes and doesn't reflect actual time travel capabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Imports:

qiskit: This library provides tools for working with quantum computers and circuits.
math: Used for the pi constant in quantum gate operations.
Function: time_travel_circuit(target_time)

This function takes an integer target_time as input.
It creates a quantum circuit with 6 qubits and 6 classical bits for measurement.
Applies Hadamard gates (H) to all qubits, putting them in a superposition state (mixture of 0 and 1).
Converts the target_time to a binary string with leading zeros to ensure a length of 6 bits. (e.g., 25 becomes '0011001').
Iterates through each bit of the binary string:
If the bit is '1', a phase gate (P(pi)) is applied to the corresponding qubit.
Applies a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits.
Measures all 6 qubits, storing the results in the classical bits.
Returns the created quantum circuit.
Example Usage:

Sets a target_time variable as an integer (e.g., 25 for 2025).
Creates a time_travel_circuit using the target_time.
Uses the Aer simulator from Qiskit to execute the circuit.
Transpiles the circuit for compatibility with the simulator.
Runs the circuit 1024 times (shots).
Retrieves the results and counts the occurrences of each measurement outcome.
Visualizes the results using a histogram.
Key Points:

This code demonstrates concepts of quantum circuits, qubits, superposition, entanglement, and measurement.
The actual process of time travel is not achievable with current technology.
